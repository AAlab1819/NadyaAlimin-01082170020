# 946A - Partition  

Given a sequence of `n` integers and we need to divide it into sequence `b` ang `c`. A sequence can be empty and we need to find the maximum possible value of `b-c`. Let all the positive elements are in sequence `b` and negative elements are in sequence `c`. For example, given `3, -2, 9, 0`, b has `3, 9, 0` and c has `-2`. the result `b-c` would be `12-(-2) = 14`, which is the maximum possible value.  

Worst case: O(n).

# 978B - File Name  

The problem given is to find out the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name that contain `xxx` as a substring. To find the solution, check the 'x' in the file name, and count it, if the 'x' counted is more than 3, than the `minumum removed number` will increased. On the other hand, if the 'x' less then 3, then the output is `0`.  

Worst Case: O(n).
