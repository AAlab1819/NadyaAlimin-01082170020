# Find the Running Median  

In this problem we need to find the median of the inputed list. Before find the median we need to make the list sorted using heapsort. Example:

inputed list {7,2,9}

First input is {7}, the output will be 7 because there is no other number in the list.  
Second input is {2,9}, the output will be 5.5 because (9+2)/2= 5.5.  
Third input is{9,2,7}, the output will be 2, because 2 is the media of the list.   
Complexity : O(nlogn)
